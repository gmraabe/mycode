So you want to be a python hero (coder)

# mycode (Python Networking Class)

This project is a python class with an emphasis on networking and learning how to version control projects with git.  

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Here is the commands to  install python and python3 using apt on Debian based Linux systems.

```
sudo apt-get install python -y              # Debian install for Python 2.x
sudo apt-get install python3 -y             # Debian install for Python 3.x
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running. Eventually, maybe we could list Python package requirements here. Since I'm not entirely sure what to put here, this is a note to myself to fill it out later.

```
Give the example
```

## Running the tests

(This will be where I have instructions on how to run automated tests for this system. Since I  currently don't have any, this is just a note that they are none at this time.)

## Deployment

Class is currently testing code on Linux Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. 

## Built With

* [Python3](https://www.python.org/) - The coding language used

## Contributing

Others are always welcome to contribute to this code.  I will always accept and appriciate any and all help from other coders.  All help would be great!
