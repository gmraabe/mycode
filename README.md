So you want to be a python hero (coder)

# mycode (Python Networking Class)

This project is a python class with an emphasis on networking and learning how to version control projects with git.  

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them. For now, maybe copy in how to install python and python3 using apt.

```
sudo apt-get install python   # Debian install for Python 2.x
sudo apt-get install python3  # Debian install for Python 3.x
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running. Eventually, maybe we could list Python package requirements here. You can remove this section for now, or make a note to yourself to fill it out later.

```
Give the example
```

And repeat other install steps...

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

(Explain how to run the automated tests for this system. We currently don't have any, so just make a note that they are none at this time.)

## Deployment

Class is currently testing code on Linux Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. 

## Built With

* [Python3](https://www.python.org/) - The coding language used

## Contributing
