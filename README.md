So you want to be a python hero (coder)

# mycode (Project Title)

One Paragraph of your project description goes here. Describe what you're trying to do. What is the purpose of putting up this repo?

Learning how to version control projects with git.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them. For now, maybe copy in how to install python and python3 using apt.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running. Eventually, maybe we could list Python package requirements here. You can remove this section for now, or make a note to yourself to fill it out later.

```
Give the example
```

And repeat other install steps...

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system. We don't have any, so just make a note that they are none at this time.

## Deployment

Here we might put additional notes about how to deploy on various systems. For now, put a note that we're testing our code on Linux Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. 

## Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - The coding language used

## Contributing

Here you could make notes about how others might contribute to your code. For right now, a friendly message saying you'll accept any and all help from other coders would be great!
